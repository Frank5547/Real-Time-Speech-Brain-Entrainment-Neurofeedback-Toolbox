### Real-Time Speech Entrainment Toolbox

# Requirements
- MATLAB R2019a or above
- Windows 10 or Linux OS (Ubuntu 20.04 or similar highly preferred)
- MATLAB's Signal Processing Toolbox
- Psychtoolbox3 must be installed prior to using this toolbox for neurofeedback sessions.
- Fieldtrip version 20200224 and a slightly modified version of the TCP/UDP/IP by Rydesäter to accomodate Matlab R2019a are already included within the toolbox

Neurofeedback represents a particular type of biofeedback whose aim is to teach self-control of brain function by measuring brain activity and presenting a feedback signal in real-time. Traditionally, neurofeedback has been used to complement treatments for various neuropsychological disorders through techniques like frequency training that attempt to change the power ratio of certain EEG frequency bands. However, to date, there are no neurofeedback approaches that look directly into modulating the neural entrainment to speech. Speech-brain entrainment, which stands for the alignment of the neural activity to the envelope of the speech input, has been shown to be key to speech comprehension. Atypical neural entrainment to speech seems to be consistently found in dyslexia and other developmental disorders. Thus, making speech entrainment neurofeedback a promising technique to obtain behavioral improvements. In this work, we present the first open-source brain-computer interface system that can be reliably used to provide speech entrainment neurofeedback while still being flexible enough to deliver more traditional coherence-based neurofeedback. In addition, it has the potential of being an open-source alternative to deliver other types of neurofeedback if configured to do so.
